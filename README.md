# terraform-aws
## This is an overview of the multi-tier cloud infrastructure I created. I utilized modular deployment to keep my code clean and readable. I also deployed instances with a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly. To ensure high security, I restricted access to the database-tier, and deployed NGINX and K3(kebernetes) on the my public-tier server for web access.
